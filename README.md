# Contestphyte

An app targeted towards small business owners and influencers that allows them to run online contests to boost brand awareness and engagement.

## Description

Contests (when ran correctly) can be a lucritive way for brands to grow awareness and gain new customers.
By incentivizing participants to share the contests in social media sites and to their contacts in return
for entries, a viral-like effect starts taking place, mobilizing your current following to spread the word on your campaign and business.

This concept of creating a viral-like contest where participants are incentivized to share is the basis of Contestphyte.
